      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I spend most of my time (aside from work) studying programming, playing video games, and writing music for hip-hop artists. I found my love for programming around 2018-2019
        after my time in the mortgage and banking industry and began my studies there, about 50% in a formal education system and the other 50% self-taught. I would like to find a job
        where i can use my programming skills to do something creative. With no professional experience under my belt, I am open to many different positions so I can get my foot in the door
        and find a good team that I can learn even more from. I am willing to learn any programming language to get the job done and can guarantee you that within a short time of being hired,
        I will be an expert at whatever knowledge I need to know for the job.</p>

      <div class="python">
        <img class="left-img" src="images/python-img.png" alt="python">
        <h3>Python ⭐⭐⭐</h3>
        <p>I am currently self-taught in Python and it is the current programming language of my studies. I am currently using
          <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHM3@kQiLwuJiyb-T0_KZjexy4XksmJpFZN1mi2eSWWlnEwJrKr2fetJQKA7kwujHws1P/">this bootcamp</a>
          by Dr. Angela Yu and plan on completing several more highly rated udemy courses on python by the end of the year.

      <div class="Csharp">
        <img class="right-img" src="images/csharp.png" alt="csharp">
        <h3>⭐⭐ C#</h3>
        <p>I spent one year at Pinellas Technical College in Tampa, Fl learning C# with a focus on Object Oriented Programming(2018-2019). I also finished several
          high rated courses on udemy using C# for video game design as well as use of the language in the physics engine called <a href="https://unity.com/">"Unity"</a>.
          Unfortunately, I encountered some financial difficulty right at the end of my classes at Pinellas Tech and was forced to resign so I could sustain myself. This
          is when my self-teching began and I learned to really find solutions to the coding problems I was facing by refining my problem searching on the internet.</p>

        <img class="left-img" src="images/html-img.png" alt="html">
        <h3>HTML/CSS ⭐</h3>
        <p>I have a basic comprehension of HTML and CSS and am more than willing to take that knowledge to the next level given an opportunity to work in web development.
          I did, afterall, make this website without the assistance of templates or apps.</p>

      <div class="music">
        <img class="right-img" src="images/ableton-logo.png" alt="ableton-img">
        <h3>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Music Production/Ableton Live</h3>
        <p>I have spent the majority of my child and adult life making music. I started in high school playing jazz trumpet and was accepted to Berklee College of Music. I tried to raise the money
        to attend but the price was just too steep. After that, I ended up going to Lonestar Community College and University of Houston where I studied Jazz Music and Music Theory. Throughout the
        years my musical taste evolved into what is it today in the Hip Hop music scene. The entirety of my music career I have used Ableton Live and currently possess all the licensed software as
        well as a home studio to meet any need regarding music or composition that may be needed on a project where original, copywrite-free music is needed.</p>

      <div class="bartending">
        <img class="left-img" src="images/bartending.gif" alt="bar-img">
        <h3>Bartending ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h3>
        <p>Bartending is my current profession and has served me well for almost a decade. I do feel my time as bartender is coming to an end due to my passion to pursue
          computer programming as a career and I am willing to leave my current, well-paid job as a bartender with the assumption I have time to give them a fair notice of my intent
          to leave. I love the work I currently do and have gained a lot of very useful skills managing bars and bartending that I know will be helpful in any work environment I find
          myself in.</p>
